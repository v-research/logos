Here you can find all the logos of V-Research

"Of this Logos being forever do men prove to be uncomprehending, both before they hear and once they have heard it. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, they are like the unexperienced experiencing words and deeds such as I explain when I distinguish each thing according to its nature and show how it is. Other men are unaware of what they do when they are awake just as they are forgetful of what they do when they are asleep." Heraclitus. Reported by Sextus Empiricus in "Against the Logicians" - trans. R.G. Bury (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935) p. 179.
